sandy - simple ncurses text editor
==================================
sandy is a simple ncurses text editor.


Requirements
------------
In order to build sandy you need the ncurses header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (sandy is installed into the
/usr/local namespace by default). Optionally, create a config.h file to 
further configure the editor at compile time. An examples file is provided as 
config.def.h.

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install sandy (use root if
needed):

    make clean install


Running sandy
-------------
Use the following syntax:

	sandy [-r] [-u] [-t TABSTOP] [-s SYNTAX] [File]

Where:
-r opens the file read-only
-u reverses the default UTF-8 behavior
-t TABSTOP sets the tabstop for this instance of sandy
-s SYNTAX  lets you specify the syntax colors for this file


Name
----
In case you are wondering, sandy was the smartest pet ferret. She died of
cancer though. We were sad and started coding this editor.
